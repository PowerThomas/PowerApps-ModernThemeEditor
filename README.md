# Power Apps Modern Theme Editor for Model-driven Apps

Easily create and update themes for Model-driven apps with Fluent 2 UI using this Power Apps canvas app.

## Background

In the [original method](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/modern-theme-overrides) to apply a theme to Model-driven apps using Fluent 2 UI, you need to create an XML web resource containing theme colors and add it to your working solution. Then, override a settings file with the corresponding web resource and publish all customizations. This process can be intricate, necessitating manual XML file creation and settings override, which could be prone to errors and might require a good understanding of the underlying system configurations. This app is designed to simplify the theming process by providing a user-friendly interface, eliminating the manual steps, and reducing the chances of errors, making theme management in Model-driven apps seamless and efficient.
